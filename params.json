{"name":"zDynLink","body":"## zdynlink\r\n\r\nMore and more applications on z/OS are doing stuff inside of Unix System Services.\r\nWebSphere being one of them.\r\n\r\nLoads of these applications are writing files there too.\r\n\r\nSuppose you have a job like the following:\r\n\r\n    //SOMEJOB    JOB  (ACCTCODE),\r\n    //                CLASS=J,\r\n    //                MSGCLASS=X\r\n    //*\r\n    //*   My Example Job\r\n    //*\r\n    //STEP01     EXEC PGM=IEBGENER\r\n    //SYSPRINT   DD   SYSOUT=*\r\n    //SYSUT1     DD   DSN=SOMEFILE,DISP=SHR\r\n    //SYSUT2     DD   PATH='/tmp/somefile'\r\n    //SYSIN      DD   DUMMY\r\n\r\nThis would then copy your 'SOMEFILE' to /tmp/somefile.\r\nBut what if you wanted to have this file within the USS environment be \r\nunique every time you ran the job?\r\n\r\nCome on in zdynlink (thanks to Bas for the name).\r\n\r\nIf, within your USS environment you would have had the *zdynlink* command your could have\r\ndone the following:\r\n\r\n    IBMUSER:/u/ibmuser: >zdynlink /tmp/somefile\r\n    Done. Any writes to /tmp/somefile will result in a file /tmp/somefile&JOBNAME.-&LYYMMDD.-&LHHMMSS.\r\n\r\nMaking your /tmp look like this :\r\n\r\n    IBMUSER:/u/ibmuser: >ls -la /tmp\r\n    lrwxrwxrwx   1 OMVSKERN SYS1          12 Jun 25  2010 /tmp -> $SYSNAME/tmp/somefile-&JOBNAME.-&LYYMMDD.-&LHHMMSS.\r\n\r\nNow what happens when you write to /tmp/somefile ?\r\n\r\n    IBMUSER:/u/ibmuser: >echo \"Just a test for github post\" > /tmp/somefile\r\n    IBMUSER:/u/ibmuser: >ls -la /tmp/\r\n    total 48\r\n    drwxrwxrwt   2 OMVSKERN SYS1        8192 Nov 19 14:23 .\r\n    drwxr-xr-x   6 OMVSKERN SYS1        8192 Jun 25  2010 ..\r\n    -rw-------   1 100000   SYS1          27 Nov 13 14:14 .sh_history\r\n    lrwxrwxrwx   1 OMVSKERN SYS1          51 Nov 19 14:21 somefile -> $SYSSYMA/tmp/somefile-&JOBNAME.-&LYYMMDD.-&LHHMMSS.\r\n    -rw-r--r--   1 OMVSKERN SYS1          28 Nov 19 14:23 somefile-IBMUSER7-111119-142316\r\n\r\nSee! You get a nice filename with JOBNAME, DATE and TIMESTAMP in it!\r\n\r\nIt's very handy on a lot of stuff. You might want to use it on \"applyPTF.out\" to name just one :)\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture version of zdynlink will enable you to select what 'SYSTEM SYMBOLS' you want to have in your symbolic link.\r\n\r\nFor now, enjoy version 0.1 and let me know what you think!\r\n","tagline":"A symbolic link generator for the z/OS ","google":"UA-30906615-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
